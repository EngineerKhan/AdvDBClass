### TODO

- Installations (both Postgres* and MongoDB)
- Practice (please refer to the handouts, like [MongoDB's](https://github.com/EngineerKhan/AdvDBClass/blob/main/Week2/MongoDB.md) or [Postgres Queries](https://github.com/EngineerKhan/AdvDBClass/blob/main/Week2/PostgresSampleQueries1.sql). You should at least know how to perform basics and how to make a stored procedure in Postgres.
- **[Quick Labs - try it yourself](https://github.com/EngineerKhan/AdvDBClass/blob/main/Week2/MongoDB.md#quick-lab-tasks-try-it-yourself)**
  


* I would recommend **TablePlus** for Postgres.
