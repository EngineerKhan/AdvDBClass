Inspired by the GitHub repo's relatively [successful experiment](https://github.com/EngineerKhan/Python-ML), I replicated the practice this fall. Quickly, it has started to grow and requires some organization. To help you navigate the repo in an easier way, I will keep updating it.

**P.S: Next week's task (in an interim form) is already uploaded on Week 5. Project ideas will be available in the Appendix.** 

**UPDATE 29 Sep: This week's notes are [uploaded](https://github.com/EngineerKhan/AdvDBClass/blob/main/Week5/Hybrid%20Search.md).**

## Course Objective

Data is everywhere and so are databases. This course is one of a kind, where you have the luxury of learning a lot of emerging technologies. Also, it's a course which is offered here for the first time (_to the best of my knowledge_) – a fact enough to give an extra motivation to both instructor and students. Our basic goals for this course are:

### Tools

After this course, you should be comfortable enough to use: **MongoDB**, **Docker**, **Qdrant**, Neo4j and (_there is one more technology I am yet to finalize_).

### Concepts

You should be able to think comfortably in SQL (which you probably already do) as well as beyond SQL. APIs, JSONs, etc., shouldn't be just a familiar thing for you; you should be able to start thinking in them.

### Analytical and other aspects

This course is much more than just some concepts and technologies. By the conclusion of the course, I expect at least 50% students to:

- Develop an analytical mindset that can use any of the tools, including the LLMs, but should know what he/she's doing and why they're doing it. **Why is the core part of our course!**
  
- Start thinking beyond the typical term projects and think of an app or website that can be a long-term investment and a proper product for you.

## FAQs

1. I am not good at Python programming. Can I still take this course?

A: Yes! You can use any other programming language of your choice. I have already seen Java and JavaScript developers in this course so far.

2. I am not good at any programming language. Can I still take this course?

A: Yes! It will require a considerable effort from you, though.

3. I wasn't good at the DB-I course. Can I understand the concepts now?

A: Yes! Almost all the contents until mid (and maybe a couple of weeks afterwards too) don't rely much on the RDBMS knowledge. You will have to learn it inevitably, but can do it in the parallel (without interrupting this course).

4. Can I use chatGPT?

A: Yes and no. It's acceptable if you wanna use chatGPT as an assistant. But if you are switching your brain off and using chatGPT blindly, this course is not for you.

5. How can we contact you?

A: Please email me: Talha (at) Acceleration (dot) pk (**please don't use chatGPT to write me emails**).

6. What is the plagiarism policy?

A: Plagiarism refers to copying someone's work without attribution. You can use someone's work in some part of the code, but **should fully attribute it and explain why you needed to use it**. Similarly, if you use chatGPT to write some code, mention it explicitly.

## Course Outline (until Mids)

- Refresher (transactions, procedures, views)
- [MongoDB](https://github.com/EngineerKhan/AdvDBClass/tree/main/Week2)
- [APIs](https://github.com/EngineerKhan/AdvDBClass/tree/main/Week3)
- [Vector DBs](https://github.com/EngineerKhan/AdvDBClass/tree/main/Week4)

---

## Project Requirements (Brief)

- **Group Project** (2-3 students per group).
- Must demonstrate:
  - Use of at least **two database paradigms** (e.g., SQL + NoSQL, SQL + Vector DB).
  - Integration with **mobile/web app**.
  - Implementation of **transactions/concurrency** in some form.
  - A **live website/app** at the end (_live means live; for a mobile app, beta version is also acceptable_).

- **Search Capabilities**: Must feature both normal and semantic search.
- **Scope**: Must be **realistic** (e.g., not a toy project).
- **No existing datasets**: Should get real data by **scraping**.
- **Bonus Points**: AI Integration.
