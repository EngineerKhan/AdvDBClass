Inspired by the GitHub repo's relatively [successful experiment](https://github.com/EngineerKhan/Python-ML), I replicated the practice this fall. Quickly, it has started to grow and requires some organization. To help you navigate the repo more easily, I will keep updating it.

**UPDATE 18 Nov: All 3 sections' results (until now) will be shared this week. Syllabus and the rest of the semester's class plans have been added.**

**UPDATE 17 Oct**: The mid-term submission and viva will be conducted next week (21 Oct onwards) as per our initial plan.

**UPDATE 29 Sep**: This week's notes are [uploaded](https://github.com/EngineerKhan/AdvDBClass/blob/main/Week5/Hybrid%20Search.md).

## Course Objective

Data is everywhere and so are databases. This course is one of a kind, where you have the luxury of learning a lot of emerging technologies. Also, it's a course which is offered here for the first time (_to the best of my knowledge_) – a fact enough to give an extra motivation to both instructor and students. Our basic goals for this course are:

### Tools

After this course, you should be comfortable enough to use: **APIs**, **MongoDB**, **Docker**, **Qdrant**, **Semantic/Hybrid search** and Redis streams atleast.

### Concepts

You should be able to think comfortably in SQL (which you probably already do) as well as beyond SQL. APIs, JSONs, etc., shouldn't be just a familiar thing for you; you should be able to start thinking in them.

### Analytical and other aspects

This course is much more than just some concepts and technologies. By the conclusion of the course, I expect at least 50% students to:

- Develop an analytical mindset that can use any of the tools, including the LLMs, but should know what he/she's doing and why they're doing it. **Why is the core part of our course!**
  
- Start thinking beyond the typical term projects and think of an app or website that can be a long-term investment and a proper product for you.

> _"Computers are useless, they can only give answers."_ – Pablo Picasso

### Think Commercially

Realize the market worth of certain tools and technologies. The laborious efforts during the semester should translate into some financial rewards as well. At the start of the semester, I wanted all of you to make a project that would be useful for you beyond the semester. Now, my expectation levels have dropped and I would be happy even if 30% of your projects end up becoming some app or a useful website (expectations may slide down further with time).

## Course Contents

Now we are in a much better position to formalize the course contents. Here they are:

### 1. APIs

APIs are the core part of our course. By the end of this semester, you all should be able to make endpoints (language and framework of your choice), call them and discern between different types of endpoints. Also, you should be able to use Postman.

### 2. MongoDB

MongoDB is also an essential part of our course. You should be able to perform basic CRUD and design aggregation pipelines.

### 3. Vector Databases

Vector DB is something that you probably wouldn't have studied in theory or some other course. We used them for storing embeddings for semantic search. And while I practically didn't cover it, many of you would be able to know that these vector DBs and embeddings are a core part of RAG and LLMs, enabling us to make smart chatbots (avenues are open for you to explore).

You should be familiar working with Qdrant, semantic/hybrid search and also Redis streams*.

### 4. Docker

### 5. OLAP

### 6. Graph Database

### 7. Data Scraping (Optional)

I won't cover it in the class. But it is a very very important tool in any data scientist's arsenal.

Here, **first 4 topics are necessary – you need to be very good at them, both theoretically and practically**.
