## Project Requirements (Brief)

- **Group Project** (2-3 students per group).
- Must demonstrate:
  - Use of at least **two database paradigms** (e.g., SQL + NoSQL, SQL + Vector DB).
  - Integration with **mobile/web app**.
  - Implementation of **transactions/concurrency** in some form.
  - A **live website/app** at the end (_live means live; for a mobile app, beta version is also acceptable_).

- **Search Capabilities**: Must feature both normal and semantic search.
- **Scope**: Must be **realistic** (e.g., not a toy project).
- **No existing datasets**: Should get real data by **scraping**.
- **Bonus Points**: AI Integration.
