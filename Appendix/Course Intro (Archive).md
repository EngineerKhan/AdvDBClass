## FAQs

1. I am not good at Python programming. Can I still take this course?

A: Yes! You can use any other programming language of your choice. I have already seen Java and JavaScript developers in this course so far.

2. I am not good at any programming language. Can I still take this course?

A: Yes! It will require a considerable effort from you, though.

3. I wasn't good at the DB-I course. Can I understand the concepts now?

A: Yes! Almost all the contents until mid (and maybe a couple of weeks afterwards too) don't rely much on the RDBMS knowledge. You will have to learn it inevitably, but can do it in the parallel (without interrupting this course).

4. Can I use chatGPT?

A: Yes and no. It's acceptable if you wanna use chatGPT as an assistant. But if you are switching your brain off and using chatGPT blindly, this course is not for you.

5. How can we contact you?

A: Please email me: Talha (at) Acceleration (dot) pk (**please don't use chatGPT to write me emails**).

6. What is the plagiarism policy?

A: Plagiarism refers to copying someone's work without attribution. You can use someone's work in some part of the code, but **should fully attribute it and explain why you needed to use it**. Similarly, if you use chatGPT to write some code, mention it explicitly.

## Course Outline (until Mids)

- Refresher (transactions, procedures, views)
- [MongoDB](https://github.com/EngineerKhan/AdvDBClass/tree/main/Week2)
- [APIs](https://github.com/EngineerKhan/AdvDBClass/tree/main/Week3)
- [Vector DBs](https://github.com/EngineerKhan/AdvDBClass/tree/main/Week4)
- Hybrid Search, Elastic Search
- RAG

> **Mids lab will be done without any internet access, so please get your hands dirty on these topics asap. In week 6, I won't teach any new topic and will just help you practice these concepts. In return, I will expect you to be able to perform mid's task independently without any internet**.

## Project Requirements (Brief)

- **Group Project** (2-3 students per group).
- Must demonstrate:
  - Use of at least **two database paradigms** (e.g., SQL + NoSQL, SQL + Vector DB).
  - Integration with **mobile/web app**.
  - Implementation of **transactions/concurrency** in some form.
  - A **live website/app** at the end (_live means live; for a mobile app, beta version is also acceptable_).

- **Search Capabilities**: Must feature both normal and semantic search (in other words, hybrid search).
- **Scope**: Must be **realistic** (e.g., not a toy project).
- ~**No existing datasets**: Should get real data by **scraping**.~ (Removed this restriction)
- **Bonus Points**: AI Integration.
