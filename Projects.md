## Projects

Projects are the ultimate outcome of this course. Their evaluation rubric will be:

- Idea: 10%
- Design: 10%
- Progress throughout the semester: 10% (many have already secured 10 in it)
- Finishing the MVP and launching it: 40% (yes!)
- Final evaluation: 30%

## Project's Final Evaluation

Project's final evaluation will be done on Dec 9 (sec C), 10 (sec B) and 11 (sec A). Evaluation will be group-wise (please make sure to have your group members available for the day).

## Finishing the MVP

MVP means MVP and is meant to be launched. I can understand that mid of Dec is too early, so I can give you guys time until the 28th to complete your MVP and launch it. Those 40% will be marked then. 
And its binary marking: either you launch it and get marks or you don't (I mean it).
